When starting a new project I typically follow this trajectory. First, think of all the great things it could be. Then, initiate work. Finally, I inevitably give up as my lofty expectations wilt under the harsh light of reality.

Going forward, I'll take a more iterative approach. Instead of working on the largest most exciting project, which will never be completed, I'll start small. This is the opposite approach.

My questions for each day will be:

- What's the smallest thing I can work on today?
- What can I do at this moment to add incremental value?
- Can I make life easier in a small way for those around me?

Of course, this could be a false start and lead to nothing. But it's worth a try.

Fingers crossed! ðŸ¤ž
